1. Installations
This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib
keras.preprocessing.image
os
pandas (optional for data analysis)

2. Project Motivation
This project is designed as a practical introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. The objective is to classify images into one of two categories: cats or dogs. The motivation is to explore the power of deep learning in solving visual recognition problems.
The key business questions addressed in this project are:
How can we effectively classify images into categories using a CNN?
What are the steps required to preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance?
By working through this project, we aim to:
Understand the process of building a CNN for image classification.
Gain hands-on experience in training and testing models.
Learn how to make predictions on new, unseen data.

3. File Descriptions
This project contains the following folders and files:
Dataset: Contains images of cats and dogs divided into training and test sets.
training_set: Subfolders for cats and dogs.
test_set: Subfolders for cats and dogs.
single_prediction: A folder for testing the trained model with a single image.
Notebook File: The main implementation file, where the CNN is built and trained.
Model Output: Saved models (optional) for reuse.

4. Results
The main findings of the project are:
The CNN model successfully classifies images of cats and dogs with an accuracy above 75% on the test set.
The model performs well on unseen images, demonstrating its generalization capability.
Detailed results, including accuracy and loss plots, are included in the notebook.

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
This project was developed as an academic exercise. All image data was sourced from publicly available datasets or generated for educational purposes. Special thanks to the open-source contributors of TensorFlow and Keras.
